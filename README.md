# Library Management System

This project is a simple SQL-based Library Management System designed to manage books, members, and book loans in a library. The system supports basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, making it easy to maintain and track book inventory, membership details, and borrowed books. 

The project demonstrates how SQL can be used to interact with a relational database, making it suitable for educational purposes or small-scale libraries. You can extend the system to add more features, such as fines for overdue books, book reservations, and more.

### Features:
- **Books Management**: Add, update, delete, and view book details.
- **Members Management**: Manage member information, including joining dates.
- **Loan Records**: Track which books have been borrowed and returned, including due dates.

This project can be used to practice and enhance SQL skills, particularly database design, data querying, and data management.
